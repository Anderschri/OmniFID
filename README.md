# Omnidirectional FID
Repository for [Geometry Fidelity for Spherical Images](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18207), accepted at ECCV 2024.  

A reimplementation of the code for calculating OmniFID and DS will be added to this repository (currently waiting for approval). 
A public reimplementation by the Wang et al. for the paper [A Survey on Text-Driven 360-Degree Panorama Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14799) can be found [Here](https://github.com/littlewhitesea/Text-Driven-Pano-Gen)
